# tictactoe

Version1 - Sept 2022
Here I created a command line tictactoe mini-game using Ruby.

It accept turns for two active players and returns the current state of the board between turns.

Basic command line functionality but code structure can be improved. Game classes are defined but require a separate script to function. Position definitions are also unclear. Will refactor in part 2 (test-driven development, Dec 2022).
